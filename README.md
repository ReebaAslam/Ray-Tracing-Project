# Project II: Extending the Ray Tracer
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2019
#### Class project with Nisha Shaikh, Reeba Aslam, Sami Murtaza and Syed Ahsan 

## Purpose

This project extends the ray tracer developed previously. It implements some of the ray tracing topics we have covered, namely:

- ray casting
- brdf's
- anti-aliasing
- light sources
- acceleration structures

## Background

For this homework, you must

- have a working solution to Homework 5
- know how to read and write object oriented code in C++
- understand the concepts listed above
- know how to compile a c++ project spanning multiple files in multiple directories
- know vector arithmetic

## The Problem Set

The problems are defined in `main.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.


## Submission

### Problem Set

	Submit _all_ code files in the `raytracer` folder. `World.cpp` should include the relevant file from the `build` folder corresponding to the high-res version of your showcase scene. Other `World::build` implementations (e.g. for the low-res version, or used to generate other pictures on your web page) should be included in the `build` folder. Compiling and running `raytracer.cpp` in the `raytracer` folder should generate the low-res image.

Include a `website` folder that includes your website, either as HTML, markdown, or a URL. The submitted web page must be complete, i.e. all required assets are submitted and no links are broken.
